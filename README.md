### Overview

This repository focuses on **Meta-Learning-based Percussion Transcription** and **Tala Identification** using low-resource audio data. The two primary tasks include:

1. **Percussion Transcription**:

   - **Tabla Stroke Transcription (TST)**: Identifying and classifying Tabla strokes from audio.

   - **Automatic Drum Transcription (ADT)**: Extracting drum strokes and their timing information from drum audio tracks.

2. **Tala Identification**:

   - Recognizing and analyzing rhythmic cycles (Tala) in Hindustani classical music.

### 


To facilitate research in these areas, this repository includes:

  1.  **Presentation**: A PowerPoint file that explains key concepts of rhythm in Hindustani music, including the structure of Tala.

  2.  **Synthetic_Mridangam_Stroke_Dataset_D_M**: A curated dataset of synthetic Mridangam strokes for audio research and analysis.


___


  The dataset contains synthetic audio samples of Mridangam strokes.  The Mridangam, a prominent South Indian percussion instrument, is widely used in Carnatic music and has distinctive rhythmic patterns.
